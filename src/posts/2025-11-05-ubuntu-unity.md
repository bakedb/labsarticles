## Day 1
I just switched from Arch with KDE Plasma to Ubuntu Unity, so this will feel a bit different. I have never used the Unity desktop environment. I decided to make a separate home partition while installing to make distro hopping easier. I have used Ubuntu for a while before with Ubuntu Budgie on my main PC. I am using a ThinkPad 13, so the Fn key is where the Ctrl key usually is. This is quite irritating, but I figured out that I can swap them in the BIOS settings.

So far, using Unity has been pretty straightforward. The first thing I learned was that you can hold down Meta to bring up a keybinds cheat sheet, which will probably be very useful. You can press Meta to bring up Dash, which is basically what happens when you press Meta on any other desktop environment, except fullscreen. So far, I have only used it to find files once, and that was just now when I tested to see how good it is by looking for this Markdown file that I am typing in. It seems to be very good at finding files. There is also a bar on the left called the Launcher, and it looks like it usually does in modern Ubuntu (I think... I have only used modern Ubuntu once in a live image to format a hard drive). One thing that I have heard that people do not like about it is that they cannot move it from the left side. Personally, I don't care. Sometimes the icons on the launcher don't want to cooperate and sometimes open applications in another duplicate icon, but I think I figured that out. Lastly, I don't know how the Launcher decides to open apps, but sometimes it opens something and the icon is at the bottom of the list of icons, and sometimes it is halfway through.

I'm back to using the apt package manager, switching from pacman and the AUR. It seems that they are pretty similar: check if your package is on pacman/apt, if not, use yay/snap. Of course, LibreWolf (my browser of choice) was on neither on apt or snap. One point to the AUR.

> Editor's note, 3 November 2026: Actually, LibreWolf is now in the official pacman repositories, so you can just use `sudo pacman -S librewolf`!

 Also, when installing VSCode, it told me to use ```sudo snap install code --classic```. I don't know what the classic was for, but whatever. Apparently, it didn't like the snap package for VSCode, and it wouldn't launch. So, I had to use ```echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list```. I have no idea what that means, but Reddit told me to. After pasting that into this Markdown file, VSCode is slowing down so hard, and I have no idea why.

I think that wraps up all of my thoughts for the first day. VSCode is still slowing down like crazy, so I think my performance tolerance is about to reach it's limit anyways.

## Day 2
I have not seen any problems with this distro so far, but I can see why some people wouldn't like it. Of course, anyone who doesn't like Ubuntu or Debian distros wouldn't want to use it, but there are some things that people would not like about the desktop environment. First, pressing Meta opens up the Dash menu that covers the entire screen, which reminds me of Windows 8. The thing that I have seen the most people complain about in Unity is the Launcher being stuck on the left. As for me, I have not encountered any issues yet, and it has been quite a smooth experience. Of course, all I do on this laptop is use VSCode, manage files, and browse the web, so if I used this on my main PC, I would definitely have more issues. Also, one thing that I don't like but don't care that much about is that there are no themes like there are in KDE Plasma and the like. You're just stuck with the default one, as far as I'm aware. Of course, I may be wrong.

I didn't talk about this on day 1 because I thought that it would bring some unnecessary negative energy, but my installation experience was terrible. Now, I'm not talking about installing Ubuntu Unity in the live environment, I'm talking about the troubles I went through to get the boot USB working. First, I had a Ventoy USB that I use to boot multiple ISOs on one drive, so I put the Unity ISO on there. Of course, that didn't work, so I installed BalenaEtcher on my Mac and flashed a blank USB I had with the image. That didn't work either. Then, I tried the Ventoy USB again, and for some reason, it worked. So, I booted into the Unity ISO and installed it. I chose to do my own partitioning because I wanted to have a separate home partition, but I ended up messing up the tables when making a Grub partition because it told me to do so if I wanted GPT instead of MBR. Then everything came crumbing down after that. I realized I needed to reinstall after it wouldn’t boot from the SSD, so then I put the Ventoy USB back in and tried to load the ISO, only for Ventoy to not work again. After many minutes of crying and Reddit searching (both being a daily occurrence as a Linux user), I tried the Ventoy USB once again, and lo and behold, it worked. I made my partition table and didn’t try to make it GPT this time, and it finally booted.

To finish up for today, VSCode started slowing down again to the point of being pretty much unusable in the middle of the last paragraph, so I had to resort to the generously preinstalled LibreOffice Writer. It’s not the best for Markdown, but at least I can correct all of my spelling errors. Of course, it’s not the best spelling correction. It doesn’t know what a VSCode or a Reddit is, and it does not think that ‘sudo’ or ‘distro’ are words. Those are all expected. And then, it tries to correct me on ‘SSD’, ‘keybinds’, and even ‘fullscreen’. It’s annoying, but I’m ok with it if it helps me with normal spelling errors.

(It just tried to correct ‘ok’ to ‘os’, ‘oi’, ‘oo’, ‘AI’, ‘HP’, ‘IoT’, ‘LG’, ‘UI’, or ‘UX’!?)

## Day 3
Today will be the last day of me trying out Ubuntu Unity. I decided to try out dual monitors, and after a few confusing minutes of me forgetting to click 'Apply', I am now using my external monitor. Besides some issues relating to VSCode and the possibly unsatisfactory Launcher panel, the only other thing I have found that I don't like about Unity is that the top menu bar sometimes does not show the background color transparency effect and is just solid gray or black. I don't know why that happens, but whatever, it doesn't really matter. I like Unity, and I might want to try it again.

# Review
Ubuntu Unity is just Ubuntu with the Unity DE on top, as you might expect. Throughout my short time using it, I have really only come across 1 or 2 bugs that don't really effect me that much. Unity is a pretty good DE, and I would use it again. 7/10.
